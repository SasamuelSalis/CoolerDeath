Sam's Cooler Death Screen

Hello everyone! It's me, the main menu guy again.

This is another mod I made for personal use. Same old story. I wanted to change something in the game and there was no mod for it, so I made one myseWhat does this mod do?
This mod completely overhauls the death screen experience, replacing the boring default death screen with a much cooler one full of pIzZaZz.

Features:
[*]Death text based on how you died
[*]Alot of random death messages
[*]Smooth fade in animation
[*]Fully configurable - toggle features on/off to your liking!

Customization Options:
[*]Show/Hide death messages
[*]Show/Hide coin loss display
[*]Show/Hide respawn timer
[*]Enable/disable dark background
[*]Adjust background darkness
[*]Toggle fade effect

You can check out my other mods on my profile if you want to see more stuff I've made.

Have fun with the mod! (NOTE: other death screen mods MAY conflict with this one)

Stay cool!
